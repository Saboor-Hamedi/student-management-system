# user_id on table classes belongs to the teachers 
# I add teacher names on class table because I search through their names, we could leave it null
# or empty, but I thought it would be good to have teacher names on classes table
# Also, we can control student and admin with user_id

# I have readonly input on add-object.php file, which gets the teacher ID or user_id 
# that ID load through ajax, which is called load-teachers.js


# classes would work as schedule
