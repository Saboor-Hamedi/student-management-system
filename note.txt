# This is a simple documentation of my project, this has been developed to change the manual school systems into a web based system. 
## By no means this project is perfect, but I say one thing for sure this project fulfill alot of the requirements of schools. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Here are the documentations for the project. 
 This project is build within php and using mariabd as its database to store data. This project has used OOP concept to reduce the redundancy and make it more powerful.

# The rules:
  We have a pretty clean Auth classs with its able to control the authenticated users, 
  at the moment there are three four differen users in our database, admin, teachers, students, and 
  parents. All those users denoted as follows:
  admin == 0 
  student == 1
  teachers == 2
  parants == 3 
   #NOTE you can add as much user as you want. 
  # Authenticate users: 
    visit config/Auth.php for more details. Here is how to control users 
    lets says you logged in to your project as admin. 
    admin.php 
      if you want this page to be shown only for admin simple call 
      Auth::authenticate([0]) on the top of the page. If you want to allow more users in this page, 
      you can simply add the roles of the user inside the authenticate e.g, Auth::authenticate([0,1,2,3]).
